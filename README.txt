Description:

Gerrymandering is creating voting districts in such a way that gives one party an unfair advantage over the other. Political 
parties do this to try to help themselves stay in power. 

For this project, I wrote a code that determines whether the state’s districts are gerrymandered, according to the 
researchers’ definition. The input data about states’ districts and total voters comes from two input files.

This program can:
1. load in voting data (and display it to the screen),
2. search the data for a particular state,
3. plot all the districts’ votes of that particular state,
4. display the calculated stats for that particular state.
